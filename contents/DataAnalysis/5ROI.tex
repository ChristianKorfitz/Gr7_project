\section{Selecting ROIs for statistical test}

After application of the correction method contain the signals of some ROIs still jumps what makes them for further data processing useless. Therefore each signal and its scalogram has been submitted a visual control. A table (Appendix) was used to evaluate each region in each subject within both conditions concerning the appearance of jumps after applied correction method and usability regarding further data processing.

With the aid of this evaluation table five RIOs have been chosen to use. The criterion for this selection was, that those ROIs showed in measurements good response to the correction method. All five ROIs are located in the back of the hand.

\section{Software setting}

To interface the Xenics camera, Xeneth 2.6 software was used.   
Sampling rate for the thermal imaging camera was set to the lowest possible at $6.25 Hz$. This should be sufficient according to the Nyquist theory \cite{weik2001}, when the frequencies of interest lies within $0.005 Hz-2 Hz$ as presented in \cref{freq}. Ambient temperature and room temperature were set to 25$^{\circ}$ and emissivity to 1.

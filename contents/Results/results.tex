\chapter{Results}
\textit{In this chapter the results on behalf of the data analysis will be shown. A paired t-test of the mean magnitude for each frequency band specified in \ref{sec:thermalImaging} is computed to test the likelihood of finding a difference between the uncuffed and cuffed conditions.}

\section{Paired t-test}
The boxplots can be seen in \figref{fig:boxEndo} throughout \figref{fig:boxMyo}. The boxplots show points for each mean magnitude for each subject ordered by color, a line is connecting the before and after condition to indicate if there has been an increase or decrease in magnitude.

%In the paired t-test none of the data from the frequency bands show a significant difference between subject in cuffed and uncuffed condition. 
The outcome of the paired t-test is a table showing the p-values, which is shown in \ref{my:pval}.

	\caption{Table showing the p-values corresponding to specific ROI in correlation with frequency band.}
	\scalebox{0.8}{
	\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
		\hline
		& \textbf{P-endo} & \textbf{P-myo}  & \textbf{P-neuro} \\ \hline
		\textbf{ROI 10} & 0.7116 & 0.8454 & 0.9389  \\ \hline
		\textbf{ROI 14} & 0.6254 & 0.9237 & 0.6955  \\ \hline
		\textbf{ROI 20} & 0.4141 & 0.9237 & 0.8004  \\ \hline
		\textbf{ROI 21} & 0.4062 & 0.9564 & 0.8452  \\ \hline
		\textbf{ROI 22} & 0.3826 & 0.9323 & 0.1552  \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}}
	\label{my:pval}
\end{table}
As indicated in table \ref{my:pval}, all of the tests show a significance level well above 0.005, which means that $h_{0}$ is not rejected, whereby there is no difference between the two conditions. %The lowest p-value is presented in region 22 where a p-value of 0.1552 for the neurogenic band is found. 
When reflecting the p-values onto the boxplots the correlation between the p-values and the occurrence of a difference in the dataset can be seen. For instance the lowest p-value of 0.1552 indicates the greatest difference between means, this can also be seen in figure \figref{fig:boxNeuro} for ROI 22. 
  
%\section{T-value mapping}
%Results illustrated on \figref{fig:black}, shows a t-value mapped image from a summation of each subjects scalogram within the two conditions. The y-axis shows the number of different frequencies and the x-axis is time, giving in number of frames. Each pixel within the image has a t-value corresponding to the test of the uncuffed pixel value compared to the cuffed pixel value. The larger t-value, the brighter a pixel will appear in the image. The image showed no areas where a greater difference could be observed. Mostly individual pixels lid up showing a great difference, but as these are individual and not part of an area, these are considered outliers.

%Neither of the images corresponding to each region showed areas where vasomotion activity could be identified. The remaining t-value mapping images can be seen in \cref{t-value}.  
%The number of positive and negative t-values for each frequency band in every region is compared in \cref{tab:t}. Positive t-values indicate a drop in amplitude from the uncuffed state to the cuffed and negative values the opposite. No

%T is simply the calculated difference represented in units of standard error. The greater the magnitude of T (it can be either positive or negative), the greater the evidence against the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference. The closer T is to 0, the more likely there isn't a significant difference.

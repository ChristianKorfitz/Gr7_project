abstract = {SUMMARY: Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality in critically ill patients. The pathophysiology of sepsis involves a highly complex and integrated response, including the activation of various cell types, inflammatory mediators, and the haemostatic system. Recent evidence suggests an emerging role of the microcirculation in sepsis, necessitating a shift in our locus away Irom the macrohaemodynamics to ill icrohaemodynanmics in a septic patient. This review article provides a brief overview of the microcirculation, its assessment techniques, and specific therapies to resuscitate the microhaemodynamics.},

abstract = {A time-frequency approach using wavelets to study movements at different angular velocities is considered. The authors summarized the application of the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to the analysis of the surface myoelectric (ME) signal. The present technique of determining MNF has the advantage that it is possible to determine the frequency content of the ME signal during short and nonstationary contractions. In addition, the CWT method is very reliable for the analysis of nonstationary biological signals and does not require any smoothing function as do methods based on Wigner-Ville. However, using time-frequency methods involves two main tradeoffs: i.e., potential increases in performance for a given application versus computational complexity and storage requirements. Our results confirmed earlier studies that MNF is independent of angular velocity.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION The blood flow response to relative levels of blood flow restriction (BFR) across varying cuff widths is not well documented. With the variety of cuff widths and pressures reported in the literature, the effects of different cuffs and pressures on blood flow require investigation. PURPOSE To measure blood pressure using three commonly used BFR cuffs, examine possible venous/arterial restriction pressures, and measure hemodynamic responses to relative levels of BFR using these same cuffs. METHODS 43 participants (Experiment 1, brachial artery blood pressure assessed) and 38 participants (Experiment 2, brachial artery blood flow assessed using ultrasound, cuff placed at proximal portion of arm) volunteered for this study. RESULTS Blood pressure measurement was higher in the 5 cm cuff than in the 10 and 12 cm cuffs. Sub-diastolic relative pressures appear to occur predominantly at {\textless}60{\%} of arterial occlusion pressure (AOP). Blood flow under relative levels of restriction decreases in a non-linear fashion, with minimal differences between cuffs [resting: 50.3 (44.2) ml min(-1); 10{\%} AOP: 42.0 (36.8); 20{\%}: 33.6 (28.6); 30{\%}: 23.6 (20.4); 40{\%}: 17.1 (15.9); 50{\%}: 12.5 (9.4); 60{\%}: 11.5 (8.1); 70{\%}: 11.4 (7.0); 80{\%}: 10.3 (6.3); 90{\%}: 7.9 (4.8); 100{\%}: 1.5 (2.9)]. Peak blood velocity remains relatively constant until higher levels ({\textgreater}70{\%} of AOP) are surpassed. Calculated mean shear rate decreases in a similar fashion as blood flow. CONCLUSIONS Under relative levels of restriction, pressures from 40 to 90{\%} of AOP appear to decrease blood flow to a similar degree in these three cuffs. Relative pressures appear to elicit a similar blood flow stimulus when accounting for cuff width and participant characteristics.},

abstract = {Although the function of rhythmic contractions in the vascular wall - vasomotion - is still under debate, it has been suggested to play a significant role for tissue oxygen homeostasis and under pathological conditions where tissue perfusion is affected. Vasomotion has further been suggested to be important for blood pressure control and has been shown to be reduced in diabetes. Vasomotion is initiated by the coordinated activation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in the vascular wall leading to rhythmic contractions. We have suggested the model for generation of this rhythmic activity and have shown that vasomotion initiates via interaction between intracellular calcium released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and changes in membrane potential. Rhythmic changes in intracellular calcium induce, under certain conditions (in the presence of sufficient concentration of cGMP), changes in membrane potential that lock the electrically-connected SMCs into phase. Synchronized depolarization induces synchronous calcium influx and thus produces rhythmic contraction of blood vessels. I have demonstrated and characterized a new chloride channel in vascular SMCs, which has properties necessary to coordinate SMCs in the vascular wall. Chloride channels have been investigated for many years but remained somewhat in the shadow of cation channels. We know now the molecular structures of some chloride channels, i.e. GABA receptors, "cystic fibrosis transmem-brane conductance regulator" (CFTR) and the ClC chloride channel family. There is one particular group of chloride channels, the calcium activated chloride channels (CaCCs), whose molecular structure is debated still. There are currently no pharmacological tools that activate or inhibit CaCCs with any significant selectivity. The existence of CaCCs in almost all cells in the body has been known for many years based on electrophysiological and other functional studies. CaCCs have been suggested to be important for regulation of membrane potential and cellular volume, as well as for body homeostasis. CaCCs are well characterized in vascular tissues but only at the functional level. The lack of their molecular structure makes it difficult to study the clinical significance of these channels. Based on patch clamp measurements of ion currents, I have previously characterized in SMCs a chloride current with unique properties. This chloride current activated by cGMP, has very high sensitivity to calcium and can be inhibited by low concentrations of zinc ions, while the traditional inhibitors of CaCCs affect this current only at very high concentrations. This cGMP-dependent, calcium-activated chloride current has a linear volt-age-dependence, which differs from previously characterized CaCCs, and it has characteristic anion permeability. This current has been detected in SMCs isolated from a number of different vascular beds but, importantly, it has not been detected in pulmonary arteries. Moreover, this current has been shown in SMCs isolated intestine indicating its broad distribution. Based on unique characteristics I have suggested that the cGMP-dependent calcium-activated chloride current can synchronize SMCs in the vascular wall and that bestrophin protein could be the molecular substrate for this current. Bestrophin has been characterized first as a gene in which mutations cause vitelliform macular dystrophy (VMD) or Best diseases. Based on heterologous expression it has been suggested that bestrophin is a chloride channel. This question is nevertheless controversial since caution should be taken in heterologous expression of calcium-activated chloride channel candidates. The presence of chloride channels in virtually all living cells is an essential problem as well as the dependence of ion channel properties on the complex interaction of many cellular proteins. I was the first who coupled the endogenous chloride current to one of four known bestrophin isoforms. PCR and Western blot studies on different blood vessels demonstrated the presence of bestrophin-3 protein with the exception of pulmonary arteries where the cGMP-dependent current is also absent). There was a strong indication that bestrophin-3 expression could be essential for the cGMP-dependent calcium-activated chloride current. To couple bestrophin-3 expression and this current I have used small interfering RNA (siRNA) technique to downregulate the expression of the candidate (bestrophin-3) and have studied the effect of this specific downregulation on chloride currents. I showed that bestrophin-3 expression is associated with the cGMP-dependent calcium-activated chloride current. This study does not tell us whether bestrophin-3 forms the channel or it is an essential subunit but the previous mutagenic experiments suggested the first possibility. Electrical communication between SMCs is essential for successful synchronization and depends on channels between the cells called gap junctions. The majority of cardiovascular diseases (e.g. hypertension and atherosclerosis) are associated with defects in intercellular communications or in gap junction regulation. The molecular mechanisms responsible for these defects are un-known because of lack of specific experimental tools. Our comprehensive study on the often used gap junction inhibitors heptanol and 18$\beta$-glycyrrhetinic acid demonstrated unspecific effects of these drugs at the concentrations where they have no or little gap junctions effects. Other drugs, e.g. 18$\alpha$-glycyrrhetinic acid and connexin-mimetic peptides are better to inhibit gap junctions but also have demonstrated unspecific effects. Previous studies suggested that channels and transporters in the cell membrane do not function independently but interact as functional units in the spatially restricted areas of the cell. I have demonstrated a close functional interaction between gap junctions and Na+,K+-ATPase, Na+/Ca2+-exchanger and ATP-dependent K+ channels in the spatially restricted manner. I have shown that inhibition of the ouabain-sensitive Na+, K+-ATPase inhibits calcium efflux by the Na+/Ca2+-exchanger and this leads to the local elevation of intracellular calcium and inhibition of intercellular communications. This explains the inhibitory action of ouabain on vasomotion. I have also found that the ATP-dependent K+ channel is an important player in this functional unit and this interaction is reciprocal, since K+ channel supplies Na+, K+-ATPase with K+ ions while the ATP-dependent K+ channel current also regulates the Na+, K+-ATPase. This dissertation is based on nine scientific publications where I have suggested the model for generation of vasomotion and characterized the essential elements of this model.},

These techniques provide significant pathophysiologic and prognostic information. TcPO(2) and TcPCO(2) diagnose and classify the extent of arterial disease in the leg ulcers caused by arterial disease; the prognostic value is recognized, though doubts about its prognostic potential exist in the case of leg ulcer. Laser Doppler flowmetry is able to identify the first functional impairment in the early stages of the arterial disease and in the complicated venous insufficiency. Capillaroscopy gives us morphological and quantitative parameters of the capillary bed that is damaged in arteriopathic and venous ulcers; nevertheless, it does not provide us with definite prognostic indexes.

abstract = {Brothers RM, Wingo JE, Hubing KA, Crandall CG. Methodological assessment of skin and limb blood flows in the human forearm during thermal and baroreceptor provocations. blood flow responses in the human forearm, assessed by three com-monly used technologies—single-point laser-Doppler flowmetry, in-tegrated laser-Doppler flowmetry, and laser-Doppler imaging—were compared in eight subjects during normothermic baseline, acute skin-surface cooling, and whole body heat stress (⌬ internal temper-ature ϭ 1.0 Ϯ 0.2°C; P Ͻ 0.001). In addition, while normothermic and heat stressed, subjects were exposed to 30-mmHg lower-body negative pressure (LBNP). Skin blood flow was normalized to the maximum value obtained at each site during local heating to 42°C for at least 30 min. Furthermore, comparisons of forearm blood flow (FBF) measures obtained using venous occlusion plethysmography and Doppler ultrasound were made during the aforementioned pertur-bations. Relative to normothermic baseline, skin blood flow decreased during normothermia ϩ LBNP (P Ͻ 0.05) and skin-surface cooling (P Ͻ 0.01) and increased during whole body heating (P Ͻ 0.001). Subsequent LBNP during whole body heating significantly decreased skin blood flow relative to control heat stress (P Ͻ 0.05). Importantly, for each of the aforementioned conditions, skin blood flow was similar between the three measurement devices (main effect of device: P Ͼ 0.05 for all conditions). Similarly, no differences were identified across all perturbations between FBF measures using plethysmogra-phy and Doppler ultrasound (P Ͼ 0.05 for all perturbations). These data indicate that when normalized to maximum, assessment of skin blood flow in response to vasoconstrictor and dilator perturbations are similar regardless of methodology. Likewise, FBF responses to these perturbations are similar between two commonly used methodologies of limb blood flow assessment.},

abstract = {It is well established that skin temperature oscillations in fingertips coexist with blood flow oscillations and there is a certain correlation between them. At the same time, the reasons for differences in waveform and the delay between the blood flow and temperature oscillations are far from being fully understood. In this study we determine the relationships between spectral components of the blood flow and temperature oscillations in fingertips, and we ascertain the frequency dependences of amplitude attenuation and delay time for the temperature oscillations. The blood flow oscillations were considered as a source of thermal waves propagating from micro-vessels towards the skin surface and manifesting as temperature oscillations. The finger temperature was measured by infrared thermography and blood flow was assessed by photoplethysmography for ten healthy subjects. The time-frequency analysis of oscillations was based on the Morlet wavelet transform. The frequency dependences of delay time and amplitude attenuation in temperature compared with blood flow oscillations have been determined in endothelial (0.005-0.02 Hz) and neurogenic (0.02-0.05 Hz) frequency bands using the wavelet spectra. We approximated the experimental frequency dependences by equations describing thermal wave propagation through the medium and taking into account the thermal properties and thickness of a tissue. Results of analysis show that with the increase of frequency f the delay time of temperature oscillations decreases inversely proportional to f(1/2), and the attenuation of the amplitude increases directly proportional to exp f(1/2). Using these relationships allows us to increase correlation between the processed temperature oscillations and blood flow oscillations from 0.2 to 0.7 within the frequency interval 0.005-0.05 Hz. The established experimental and theoretical relationships clarify an understanding of interrelation between the dynamics of blood flow and skin temperature, and define possibilities and limitations of temperature measurements as a method of blood flow assessment in extremities.},

The usefulness of spectral analysis in examining blood flow control mechanisms has been demonstrated, but traditional Fourier analysis does not provide sufficient resolution to reveal characteristic low frequencies. Time-frequency (wavelet) analysis was performed on 10 subjects' sacral skin blood flow responses to heating (45 degrees C) with improved resolution. Five frequency bands were identified (0.008-0.02 Hz, 0.02-0.05 Hz, 0.05-0.15 Hz, 0.15-0.4 Hz, and 0.4-2.0 Hz) corresponding to metabolic, neurogenic, myogenic, respiratory, or cardiac origins. Significant differences were observed in the mean normalized power of the metabolic (p {\textless} 0.01) and myogenic frequency bands (p {\textless} 0.01) between preheating and maximal heating and preheating and postheating periods.

abstract = {The determination of the relationship between skin blood flow and skin temperature dynamics is the main problem in thermography-based blood flow imaging. Oscillations in skin blood flow are the source of thermal waves propagating from micro-vessels toward the skin's surface, as assumed in this study. This hypothesis allows us to use equations for the attenuation and dispersion of thermal waves for converting the temperature signal into the blood flow signal, and vice versa. We developed a spectral filtering approach (SFA), which is a new technique for thermography-based blood flow imaging. In contrast to other processing techniques, the SFA implies calculations in the spectral domain rather than in the time domain. Therefore, it eliminates the need to solve differential equations. The developed technique was verified within 0.005-0.1 Hz, including the endothelial, neurogenic and myogenic frequency bands of blood flow oscillations. The algorithm for an inverse conversion of the blood flow signal into the skin temperature signal is addressed. The examples of blood flow imaging of hands during cuff occlusion and feet during heating of the back are illustrated. The processing of infrared (IR) thermograms using the SFA allowed us to restore the blood flow signals and achieve correlations of about 0.8 with a waveform of a photoplethysmographic signal. The prospective applications of the thermography-based blood flow imaging technique include non-contact monitoring of the blood supply during engraftment of skin flaps and burns healing, as well the use of contact temperature sensors to monitor low-frequency oscillations of peripheral blood flow.},

abstract = {Images rendered by uncooled microbolometer-based infrared (IR) cameras are severely degraded by the spatial non-uniformity (NU) noise. The NU noise imposes a fixed-pattern over the true images, and the intensity of the pattern changes with time due to the temperature instability of such cameras. In this paper, we present a novel model and a compensation algorithm for the spatial NU noise and its temperature-dependent variations. The model separates the NU noise into two components: a constant term, which corresponds to a set of NU parameters determining the spatial structure of the noise, and a dynamic term, which scales linearly with the fluctuations of the temperature surrounding the array of microbolometers. We use a black-body radiator and samples of the temperature surrounding the IR array to offline characterize both the constant and the temperature-dependent NU noise parameters. Next, the temperature-dependent variations are estimated online using both a spatially uniform Hammerstein-Wiener estimator and a pixelwise least mean squares (LMS) estimator. We compensate for the NU noise in IR images from two long-wave IR cameras. Results show an excellent NU correction performance and a root mean square error of less than 0.25 ∘ C, when the array's temperature varies by approximately 15 ∘ C.},

abstract = {Thermal representations on the surface of a human forearm of underlying perforator vessels have previously been mapped via recovery-enhanced infrared imaging, which is performed as skin blood flow recovers to baseline levels following cooling of the forearm. We noted that the same vessels could also be observed during reactive hyperaemia tests after complete 5-min occlusion of the forearm by an inflatable cuff. However, not all subjects showed vessels with acceptable contrast. Therefore, we applied a thermographic signal reconstruction algorithm to reactive hyperaemia testing, which substantially enhanced signal-to-noise ratios between perforator vessels and their surroundings, thereby enabling their mapping with higher accuracy and a shorter occlusion period.},
